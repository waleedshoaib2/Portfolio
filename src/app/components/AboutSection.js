            Inspired by Elliot Alderson in &quot;Mr. Robot,&quot; my journey in coding began with a fascination for the power and potential of technology. Originally on a pre-med track, I discovered my passion for coding and transitioned into software development. With three years of hands-on experience, I specialize in building robust, scalable applications.

          <p className="mt-4">
            My expertise includes Front-End Development with React.js and Next.js, Back-End Development with Node.js, and Full-Stack Development ensuring seamless integration. Driven by curiosity and a problem-solving mindset, I thrive on creating impactful software that meets user needs and pushes technological boundaries. I am also passionate about continuous learning and often engage in competitive programming and open-source projects to hone my skills.

          <p className="mt-4">
            In my free time, I enjoy playing games with friends, watching shows on Netflix, and playing football if the weather is good. I am excited about the future and the endless possibilities ahead. Let&apos;s connect and build the future together.
